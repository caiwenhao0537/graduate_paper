str1="The method involves creating a digital fingerprint (124) for a user based on constellation of digital devices. An authentication protocol is generated for authenticating the user by creating a policy that prescribes authenticating the user if a current digital environment of the user matches a digital fingerprint based on a threshold percentage of digital devices within the current digital environment of the user matching the digital devices included within the digital fingerprint. The authentication protocol is used to authenticate the user. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:a system for authenticating usersa non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising a set of instructions for authenticating users. Method for authenticating users by a computing device to access, use, and modify user accounts based on information i.e. shared secrets such as password such as user's birthplace, maiden name of user's mother or name of user's first pet, gathered from digital devices such as computing device, smart appliance and a sensing device (all claimed). Uses include but are not limited to computing device such as laptop, tablet, desktop, server, cell phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), multimedia player, and embedded system, sensing device such as thermostat, wearable device, garage door sensor, house door sensor, light sensor, light switch sensor, motion detector, window sensor, humidity sensor and sound sensor, and smart appliance such as smart refrigerator, smart coffee maker, smart toaster, gaming console, smart TV, smart switch, and smart light. The method enables effectively authenticating the user based on information that is easily known by the user and verifiable by an identity provide. The drawing shows a schematic block diagram of information included in a digital fingerprint. 124Digital fingerprintBACKGROUND Many services require users to complete an authentication process before allowing users to access, use, and/or modify user accounts. For example, an online service may require a user to demonstrate that he or she knows a “shared secret” (i.e., a “secret” known by both the user and the service). In some examples, the shared secret may be a password. In other examples, the shared secret may be information about the user, such as the user's birthplace, the maiden name of the user's mother, or the name of the user's first pet. In these examples, the service may authenticate an individual purporting to be the user if the individual demonstrates that he or she knows the shared secret. Unfortunately, shared secrets may be ineffective if they are based on information (e.g., a birthplace) that is publically available (e.g., from public records or social media) or easily obtained by unauthorized users. Similarly, passwords may be difficult for a user to remember and/or may be stolen or guessed by unauthorized users using brute force. Accordingly, the instant disclosure identifies a need for improved systems and methods for authenticating users. SUMMARY As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure describes various systems and methods for authenticating a user based on information gathered from one or more devices with which the user interacts, resulting in a shared secret that is known by the user but that is not based on publically available information and/or easily guessed using brute force. In one example, a computer-implemented method for performing such a task may include (1) identifying at least one digital device with which a user interacts, (2) gathering information about how the user interacts with the digital device, (3) generating, based on the gathered information, an authentication protocol for authenticating the user, and (4) using the authentication protocol to authenticate the user.
